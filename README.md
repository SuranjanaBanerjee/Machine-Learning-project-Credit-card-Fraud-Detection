# Machine-Learning-project-Credit-card-Fraud-Detection
This is a machine learning Project on Credit card fraud  detection,using Logistic Regression in Python

Project Highlights:

Dataset: Leveraged a robust dataset from Kaggle containing anonymized credit card transactions.

Objective: Developed a Logistic Regression model to accurately identify fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives.

Approach: Utilized Python's scikit-learn library to preprocess the data, train the Logistic Regression model, and evaluate its performance.

Results: Achieved an impressive accuracy of X% with Y% recall, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in detecting fraudulent activities.

Key Steps in the Project:

Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, scaled features, and performed feature engineering to prepare the data for training.

Model Training: Implemented Logistic Regression and fine-tuned hyperparameters to optimize the model's performance.

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy score on training data and testing data with hight accuracy rate.
